Skyblock-CE Design
##################

Create an updated version of Skyblock 2.1 enabling many of the newer renewable
blocks and items to be obtained and farmed.  Ideally, we'll be able to get
them all.  Shoot for a minimum of things given, and favor means that require
some ingenuity.

The map objectives should be modified to include the newer capabilities, and
cleaned up to be less grindy than the 2.1 objectives.

Instead of posting the objectives in the forum post, put them in a book in
the first chest.

Target is to have the map for r1.7 and r1.8.
